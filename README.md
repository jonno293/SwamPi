# SwamPi
Use Rpi to convert conventional thermostat logic to swamp (evaporative) cooler logic.

How to use files:
  SwamPi.py is the main script

  SwamPiServiceStart.py is the script run by the ongoing raspbian service to initialize SwamPi.py and put it into auto scanning mode. 

  the html folder is to be dropped into the default apache location at /var/www/ to host a manual override webpage that will override SwamPi.py for manual component operation.
